# ReDead

A mobile app originally built using Swift 2 for IOS, though it has since been updated to Swift 3.

We used [SpriteKit](https://developer.apple.com/spritekit/) to create very basic hack 'n' slash game. The goal is to fight through all 
of the enemies on each map until you are able to reach the end. On the final map, you must defeat the evil boss who controls these undead
foes to claim victory.


### Inspiration

The app's name comes from the name of the [zombie esque enemies](http://zelda.wikia.com/wiki/ReDead) in the Legend of Zelda videogame series.


### Gameplay

There are a total of 6 rooms that you have to fight through with varying sizes and amounts of enemies. Press the "A" button to swing your
sword at whatever is in front of you, and the "X" button to use one of your 8 ranged boomerang charges. Good luck!
